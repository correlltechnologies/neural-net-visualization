Saving a snippet to 'results/nn_activation.gif'...
Could not save GIF: Animation.save() got an unexpected keyword argument 'frames'

1) why are we filtering for AAPL? if so, i want to be able to select the ticker to filter for.
2) the styling on the window is bad, and the gif doesnt save. make sure all text fits within the window and looks better
3) please provide a .md file to briefly explain what the nodes mean and the input/output. is this an actual neural net? why does it make the same decisions the whole time?
